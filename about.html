        <p align="center">Hey there! My name is Eryquicc, sometimes called Quicc, or just Ery. I'm from East Java, Indonesia, and I like tech and cameras a lot, I like making and playing games, taking photos, and shooting videos. I started using a computer at the age of 3, back then my dad owns a Windows 7 PC (and still is to this day!) but the PC has no internet access. Now because there was no internet access, I started playing with the apps that are installed on there, like some Microsoft Office apps, MS Paint, Purble Place, Minesweeper, Solitaire, and so on. But then in around 2015, my dad bought me my own PC that I still use today! Back then, 8 GB of RAM and 1 TB internal storage was more than enough! I eventually bought a new monitor for it because the old one broke, and my dad also buys the same one. Now the origin of the name "Eryquicc" is actually half-inspired by a Top Gear meme, where Hammond tastes the concoction made from the V8 blender, with the caption "ery nice" on top.</p>

        <p align="center">I'm always fascinated with codes, somehow. And so I started creating this website to improve my skills in HTML and CSS and to begin learning JavaScript. At the beginning it's just a simple page with the same background as now, and only uses some basic HTML and CSS, built from the ground up. And then this website got a whole visual overhaul, the design of this site is inspired by ninja_5000’s, which by the way, thanks for the help! And slowly my own features and fixes are added over time.</p>
