        <h1>Rolling Shutters in Cameras</h1><br>
        <p>While rolling shutters offer some advantages in digital cameras, such as compact size and fast frame rates,<br>they also come with several notable disadvantages that photographers should be aware of.<br>This article will explore the key drawbacks of using rolling shutters, providing insights to help photographers<br>make informed decisions when selecting camera equipment.<br>
        One of the primary disadvantages of rolling shutters is the distortion they can introduce to images.<br>Because the shutter scans the sensor from top to bottom (or left to right), fast-moving objects can appear<br>skewed or stretched in the final photograph. This "rolling shutter effect" is particularly noticeable when<br>capturing subjects in motion, such as a person or car rapidly moving across the frame.<br>The degree of distortion can vary depending on the speed of the subject and the frame rate of the camera.<br>
        Rolling shutters can also struggle in low-light conditions. Due to the sequential nature of the shutter,<br>less time is spent exposing each line of the sensor, resulting in reduced light gathering capabilities<br>compared to global shutters. This can lead to increased noise, graininess, and reduced dynamic range in images<br>captured in dimly lit environments. Photographers who often work in challenging lighting conditions may find<br>the low-light performance of rolling shutters to be a significant drawback.</p><br>
