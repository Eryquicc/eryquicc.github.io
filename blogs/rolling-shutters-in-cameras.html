        <h1>Rolling Shutters in Cameras</h1><br>
        <p>While rolling shutters offer some advantages in digital cameras, such as compact size and fast frame rates, they also come with several notable disadvantages that photographers should be aware of. This article will explore the key drawbacks of using rolling shutters, providing insights to help photographers make informed decisions when selecting camera equipment.</p><br>
        <p>One of the primary disadvantages of rolling shutters is the distortion they can introduce to images. Because the shutter scans the sensor from top to bottom (or left to right), fast-moving objects can appear skewed or stretched in the final photograph. This "rolling shutter effect" is particularly noticeable when capturing subjects in motion, such as a person or car rapidly moving across the frame. The degree of distortion can vary depending on the speed of the subject and the frame rate of the camera.</p><br>
        <p>Rolling shutters can also struggle in low-light conditions. Due to the sequential nature of the shutter, less time is spent exposing each line of the sensor, resulting in reduced light gathering capabilities compared to global shutters. This can lead to increased noise, graininess, and reduced dynamic range in images captured in dimly lit environments. Photographers who often work in challenging lighting conditions may find the low-light performance of rolling shutters to be a significant drawback.</p><br>
